This project now utilizes powerful **Github Actions** CI(Continuous Integration) to auto-compile Compressed GCC Cross & Native ARM/ARM64 Toolchain binaries by using these CI bash Build-Scripts. These CI Build-Scripts are derived from previous user-friendly build-scripts but further divided into smaller jobs to aid better build times with CI.


## Automated Toolchain Builder Workflow:

A generalized workflow used to generate and deploy these CI maintained toolchains are as follows:

## Build-Script Description:


### A. `CIBB_32b`: Raspberry Pi Toolchains CI Base Builder 32-bit

* This build-script is used in CI to generates Compressed Intermediate/Incomplete Base Bundles targeting Raspberry Pi 32-bit OSes.
* These Intermediate/Incomplete Base Bundles are then used to compile actual 32-bit Cross-Compiler Toolchains binaries.

### B. `CIBB_64b`: Raspberry Pi Toolchains CI Base Builder 64-bit

* This build-script is used in CI to generates Compressed Intermediate/Incomplete Base Bundles targeting Raspberry Pi 64-bit OSes.
* These Intermediate/Incomplete Base Bundles are then used to compile actual 64-bit Cross-Compiler Toolchains binaries.

### C. `CICTB_32b`: Raspberry Pi Toolchains CI Cross-Compiler Builder 32-bit

* This build-script is used in CI to generate Compressed Cross ARM Toolchain binaries targeting Raspberry Pi 32-bit Stretch(Debian 9) & Buster(Debian 10) OSes from Base Bundles.

### D. `CICTB_64b`: Raspberry Pi Toolchains CI Cross-Compiler Builder 64-bit

* This build-script is used in CI to generate Compressed Cross ARM64 Toolchain binaries targeting Raspberry Pi 64-bit OSes from Base Bundles.

### E. `CINTB_32b`: Raspberry Pi Toolchains CI Native-Compiler Builder 32-bit

* This build-script is used in CI to generate Compressed Native ARM Toolchain binaries targeting Raspberry Pi 32-bit Stretch(Debian 9) & Buster(Debian 10) OSes from respective Cross-Compiler Toolchain Binaries builds.


### F. `CINTB_64b`: Raspberry Pi Toolchains CI Native-Compiler Builder 64-bit

* This build-script is used in CI to generate Compressed Native ARM64 Toolchain binaries targeting Raspberry Pi 64-bit OSes from respective Cross-Compiler Toolchain Binaries builds.

### G. `x86_64TB`: Raspberry Pi CI Toolchains x86_64-Compiler Builder

* This build-script is used in CI to generate Compressed x86_64/x86 Toolchain binaries targeting Raspberry Pi Desktop OSes from scratch.
